0.12.0 - 2017-02-14
-------------------

This is the cumulative release with many backward incompatibility changes.

* Django 1.6 now longer supported.

* Frontend now a part of the open-source package.

* Flow chart visualization added

* Every _cls suffix, ex in flow_cls, activation_cls, was renamed to
  _class. The reason for that is just to be consistent with django
  naming theme.

* Django-Extra-Views integration is removed. This was a pretty creepy
  way to handle Formsets and Inlines within django class-based
  views. Instead, django-material introduce a new way to handle Form
  Inlines same as a standard form field. See details in the
  documentation.

* Views are no longer inherits and implement an Activation
  interface. This change makes things much simple internally, and
  fixes inconsistency, in different scenarios. @flow_view,
  @flow_start_view decorators are no longer callable.

* Activation now passed as a request attribute. You need to remove
  explicit activation parameter from view function signature, and use
  request.activation instead. 

* Built-in class based views are renamed, to be more consistent. Check
  the documentation to find a new view name.

* If().OnTrue().OnFalse() renamed to If().Then().Else()

* All conditions in If, Switch and other nodes receives now a node
  activation instance instead of process. So you can gen an access to
  the current task via activation.task variable.

* Same for callable in the .Assign() and .Permissions definitions.

* task_loader not is the attribute of a flow task. In makes functions
  and signal handlers reusable over different flows.

* Flow namespace are no longer hard-coded. Flow views now can be
  attached to any namespace in a URL config. 

* flow_start_func, flow_start_signal decorators need to be used for
  the start nodes handlers. Decorators would establish a proper
  locking avoids concurrent flow process modifications in the
  background tasks.

* To use celery job with django 1.8, django-transaction-hooks need to
  be enabled.
